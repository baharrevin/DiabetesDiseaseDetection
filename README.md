# DiabetesDiseaseDetection
Predict outcomes for new breast cancer cases by classifying tumors as benign or malignant using patient data, and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms.

## Project Methods
* **Simple Linear Regression:** Uses BMI as the single independent variable to understand its direct impact on disease progression.
* **Multiple Linear Regression:** Incorporates all available features to improve prediction accuracy by considering multiple factors.

## Evaluation Metrics
* RÂ² Score: Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Represents the average magnitude of prediction errors.
* Mean Squared Error (MSE): Emphasizes larger errors by squaring them.

## Tools and Libraries
* Python
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib (optional for visualization)
